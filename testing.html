	Whereas the <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Title" target="_blank">Title</a> can only make the simplest statement about the content of your article, the Abstract allows you to elaborate more on each major aspecct of the paper. The length of your Abstract should be kept to about 200-300 words maximum (a typical standard length for journals.) Limit your statements concering each segmant of the paper (i.e purpose, methods, results, etc.) to two or three sentences if possible. The Abstract helps readers decide whether they want to read the rest of the paper, or it may be the only part they can obtain via elecronic literature sesarches or in published abstracts. Therefore, enough key information (e.g., summary results, observations, trends, etc.) must be included to make the Abstract useful to someone who may want to reference your work.
